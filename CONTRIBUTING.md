# Preview.js Contributing Guide

Hello! Thank you for considering contributing to Preview.js :)

This contributing guide is quite rudimentary at the moment, feel free to suggest improvements.

Before you start, please review the [Contributor Assignment Agreement](./CAA.md). You will need to sign it before your PR can be merged.

## Repo Setup

This is a monorepo managed by [pnpm](<[url](https://pnpm.io)>) using [Turborepo](https://turbo.build) to manage builds:

- Ensure you have `pnpm` installed.
- Run `pnpm i` from the root.
- Build all packages by running `pnpm turbo build`.

## Running Tests

Unit tests are run with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) whereas end-to-end tests are run with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

You can run all unit tests across the monorepo with `pnpm turbo test`, or you can run tests for a given package with `pnpm test` from its directory.

Each framework plugin has its own end-to-end tests, which can be run with `pnpm e2e-test`.

## Working with the VS Code extension

In Visual Studio Code, hit `F5` or click ▶️ VS Code Extension in the "Run and Debug" panel.

Note that the OSS implementation of Preview.js is a simpler webview than the official packaged extension.
